What are the extensions in which a resume can be 
ChatGPT said:

Resumes are commonly shared and submitted in the following file formats:

PDF (.pdf)

The most widely used format for resumes. It preserves the layout, design, and formatting across different devices and systems.
Microsoft Word Document (.doc, .docx)

These are editable formats and often requested by recruiters for easy customization.
Plain Text (.txt)

Simple text format without any special formatting. Used in cases where applicant tracking systems (ATS) require plain text.
Rich Text Format (.rtf)

Retains some formatting and can be opened by various text editors.
HTML (.html)

Rarely used, but some people create online resumes as web pages.
Open Document Text (.odt)

An open-source alternative to Microsoft Word, used with tools like LibreOffice.
Image Files (.jpg, .png)

Occasionally used for graphic-heavy resumes or when designing resumes in non-traditional tools, though not ideal for ATS compatibility.
Online Resume Links

While not a file extension, sharing resumes via platforms like LinkedIn, personal websites, or portfolio links is becoming popular.
For professional applications, PDF or DOCX are the safest choices, ensuring both readability and compatibility.

            for page in reader.pages:
                text += page.extract_text()
    except Exception as e:

Here's a function for reading text from a .txt resume:

def read_txt(file_path):
    """
    Reads text from a TXT file.
    Args:
        file_path (str): Path to the TXT file.
    Returns:
        str: Extracted text from the TXT file.
    """
    text = ""
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            text = file.read()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error reading TXT file {file_path}: {e}")
    return text
Explanation:
open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8'): Opens the file in read mode with UTF-8 encoding to handle various character sets.
file.read(): Reads the entire content of the file.
Error Handling: Catches and logs any exceptions (e.g., file not found, encoding issues).
Let me know if you need further enhancements!
